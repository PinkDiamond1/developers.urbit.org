The Urbit Foundation offers cohort classes to cover the [App
School](/guides/core/hoon-school) curriculum jointly.

App School focuses on how to build a backend Gall agent, then on connecting it
to a React-based front-end.  When you're done, you'll be able to produce and
distribute your own Urbit apps.

If you prefer to learn as part of a group with a hands-on instructor, regular
exercises and discussions, and a completion certification, then App School Live
will be a good fit for you.

The next cohort for App School Live will begin the week of January 23, 2023.
The cohort after that is scheduled for the end of May 2023.

docs](/guides/core/app-school).
