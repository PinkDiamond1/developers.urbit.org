Periodically, the Urbit Foundation has offered synchronous cohort classes which
cover the [Hoon School](/guides/core/hoon-school) curriculum.

If you prefer to learn as part of a group with a hands-on instructor, regular
exercises and discussions, and a completion certification, then Hoon School Live
will be a good fit for you.  We seek to offer it a few times a year.

The next cohort will begin the week of March 20, 2023.  The cohort after that is
scheduled for the end of May, 2023.

  mailing list about the next opportunity.

Until then, feel free to work through the [Hoon School
docs](/guides/core/hoon-school).
